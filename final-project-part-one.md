# Outline
High-Level Summary:
In the landscape of American economics, few policies resonate as deeply with the working class as the minimum wage. Established to ensure a basic standard of living, the minimum wage has been a subject of continuous debate and adjustment. This story explores the journey of minimum wage policies in the United States and its impact on those living at or below this economic threshold.
This project explores the intricate dynamics of minimum wages in the United States, examining their historical trajectory, regional variations, and impact on workers' livelihoods. Through comprehensive data visualization techniques, the project aims to shed light on the complex interplay between minimum wages, economic factors, and social policies.

## Initial sketches

Over the years, the federal minimum wage has been raised numerous times. However, when these increases are adjusted for inflation, it becomes clear that the real value of the minimum wage has not always kept pace with the cost of living.
For example, the minimum wage in the late 1960s, adjusted for inflation, was higher than it is today, meaning that workers from that era had greater purchasing power than minimum wage workers now. This is significant because, over time, the cost of essential goods and services such as housing, food, healthcare, and education has risen, often at a rate that outstrips wage growth.
