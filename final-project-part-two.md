# Background
The federal minimum wage in the United States, established in 1938 under the Fair Labor Standards Act, was designed to create a standard of living to protect the health and well-being of employees. Since its inception, the minimum wage has been subject to numerous debates and adjustments, reflecting the changing economic landscape and living costs. This background sets the stage for a deeper exploration into how this pivotal policy has evolved and its ongoing impact on American workers.

# User research 

## Target audience
- General Public with Interest in Economic Issues
- Students with an interest in effects of economic policies on society.
- Economists and Researchers

Adopting a more personalized and targeted approach to engage the general public and students with an interest in economic issues, I focused on leveraging the insights of individuals in my immediate network who are known for their perspicacity and ability to deconstruct complex ideas. The goal was to understand how to effectively communicate intricate economic concepts, like the federal minimum wage, in a manner that resonates with a broader audience.
