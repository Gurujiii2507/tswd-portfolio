# Background
The federal minimum wage in the United States, established in 1938 under the Fair Labor Standards Act, was designed to create a standard of living to protect the health and well-being of employees. Since its inception, the minimum wage has been subject to numerous debates and adjustments, reflecting the changing economic landscape and living costs. This background sets the stage for a deeper exploration into how this pivotal policy has evolved and its ongoing impact on American workers.

## Approach
Adopting a more personalized and targeted approach to engage the general public and students with an interest in economic issues, I focused on leveraging the insights of individuals in my immediate network who are known for their perspicacity and ability to deconstruct complex ideas. The goal was to understand how to effectively communicate intricate economic concepts, like the federal minimum wage, in a manner that resonates with a broader audience.The statistics of the 3 interviewees are listed below:
- Age: 20s â€“ 30s
- Background: Economics, Computer Science, Finance


## Interview script
##### Introduction
Hi, thank you so much for agreeing to speak with me today. I'm currently working on a project for my 'Telling Stories with Data' class. The focus of my project is the federal minimum wage in the United States. I'm aiming to present data in a way that not only informs but also encourages the audience to think critically about this topic.


##### Warm-up Questions(Before Showing Wireframe)
- To start off, what's your general understanding of the federal minimum wage in the U.S.?
- Have you followed any of the recent discussions or changes regarding minimum wage?


##### Main Questions (After Showing Wireframe)
- After looking at the wireframe, did you find the flow of information easy to follow?
- Were there any parts of the presentation that you felt were particularly impactful or informative?
- Did you encounter any data or sections that you felt were redundant or not adding value to the story?
- Based on what you've seen, is there any additional information or data you think would be important to include to enhance understanding of the topic?


##### Closing
- Before we wrap up, is there anything else regarding the topic or my presentation that you'd like to discuss or suggest?


## Interview findings

1. The feedback I received was quite straightforward: the dark theme used in the minimum wage story visuals was making it hard for people to connect with the information. It seems the heavy feel of the design was getting in the way. So, I plan to lighten things up with a brighter look to make the experience more inviting. This change should help clear up any confusion and make the important information stand out better, making sure that the message gets across as intended.

2. The inclusion of real-life experiences and interviews in the story was a significant piece of feedback that I received. It highlighted a gap in the narrative: the absence of a personal touch. By integrating interviews or examples of individuals living on minimum wage, the story can gain depth and relatability. This approach will bring the statistics to life, showing the human side of the data and emphasizing the critical nature of the issue. It's a powerful reminder that the true essence of the problem is found in the day-to-day realities of those affected, which is something that pure data cannot convey on its own. Adding this element will enrich the story, making it not just a collection of facts and figures but a compelling narrative that calls for attention and action.

3. Reflecting on the feedback regarding the disconnect between the graphs and the call to action, I recognize the necessity to align the data presented with the actionable steps proposed. The visuals should not only illustrate the issue but also lead seamlessly into a clear and precise call to action. To address this, the graphs will be refined to directly support and underscore the steps that viewers can take, ensuring that each piece of data presented is purposefully directed towards the narrative's goal of inspiring action. This adjustment aims to create a cohesive narrative, where the story told by the data naturally progresses towards the advocacy and change we seek to promote.



# Identified changes for Part III

Based on the insightful feedback, identified changes for implementation include overhauling the visual design to a lighter and more engaging theme, enhancing connection with the audience. Additionally, the narrative will be enriched with personal stories from individuals living on minimum wage, adding a human dimension to the data. Finally, the data visualizations will be restructured to forge a stronger link to the call to action, ensuring the story not only informs but also motivates clear and precise steps for advocacy and change. These refinements are aimed at creating a cohesive and impactful narrative that moves the audience from awareness to action.
