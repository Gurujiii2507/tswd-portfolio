# Changes made since Part II

Since the completion of Part II, the narrative of our story, "Earning a Living: The Struggle for Fair Pay in America," has undergone significant transformations. In response to the feedback received, we embarked on a journey of adaptation and enhancement to ensure our tale not only informs but also resonates deeply with our audience.

The first change was aesthetic; the previously dark theme was replaced with a brighter, more inviting palette. This visual uplift was not merely cosmetic—it was a strategic shift to dismantle barriers to engagement. The lighter theme now acts as a welcoming canvas, allowing the data to stand out, enabling the story to be more approachable and digestible.

The data visualizations, previously a point of disconnect, have been meticulously refined. Each graph and chart has been tailored to directly support the narrative, with clear annotations and insights that guide the audience to the crux of the matter. The story now flows seamlessly from data to implication, from implication to action.

I've also broadened the scope to include additional data sets, offering a richer context to the story. By juxtaposing the minimum wage against other economic factors like housing costs and average household expenditures, we've painted a more comprehensive picture of the issue at hand.

Lastly, the call to action has been sharpened to a fine point. It's no longer a vague suggestion but a clear directive: support the movement for fair pay, exemplified by the "Fight for $15." This is underscored by an actionable plan, inviting readers to become part of the change.



## The audience

The audience for "Earning a Living" is primarily the general public with a vested interest in economic issues, alongside students, economists, and researchers keen on the effects of economic policies on society.

Interviews from various demographics—students in their 20s, economists with a policy focus, and workers directly affected by wage laws—shaped the story’s angle, making it relatable and accessible. Based on this feedback, I tailored the visual data to be more intuitive and the language to be clear and jargon-free, ensuring the story resonated with and was comprehensible to a diverse readership. This focus helped refine the final project into a compelling narrative that speaks directly to the concerns and interests of its intended audience.

## Final design decisions

Throughout the development of "Earning a Living," a series of deliberate design decisions played a pivotal role in shaping the data story. The transition to a lighter color scheme was a strategic choice to enhance readability and engagement, moving away from a gloomier aesthetic that could detract from the message. The layout was meticulously structured to guide the reader through the narrative flow, with careful consideration for the placement of personal stories to complement the data.

The integration of interactive elements was another critical design choice, aimed at fostering a participatory experience for the reader. This decision was informed by the realization that engagement goes beyond visual appeal—it requires interaction and involvement.

Typography was selected for clarity and accessibility, ensuring that the text was as compelling as the visual elements. I opted for clean, sans-serif fonts to maintain a modern and approachable look. The visual hierarchy was also crucial, with bold headings and clear annotations that directed the reader's attention to the most salient points.

As I worked through the design process, one standout lesson was the importance of iteration based on user feedback. The initial designs underwent several revisions, each time moving closer to a more effective conveyance of the story. It was a reminder that storytelling, particularly with data, is a dynamic process that benefits from adaptability and openness to change.

Additionally, I learned the value of context. By incorporating broader economic indicators and comparative data, the story gained depth and relevance, allowing readers to see the minimum wage issue not as an isolated phenomenon but as part of a larger economic tapestry.

These design decisions, rooted in the principles of user experience and visual communication, were instrumental in transforming raw data into a compelling narrative that not only informs but also inspires and calls to action. The process underscored the intricate dance between form and function—a balance between aesthetic allure and the clear, impactful delivery of information.

# Final thoughts

Reflecting on the entire process of crafting "Earning a Living," it's clear that the journey from concept to completion was both challenging and enlightening. The project evolved substantially from its initial stages, growing in depth and clarity as it progressed. One area I wish I had more time for was delving deeper into the data analysis to uncover even more nuanced insights and perhaps offer a more granular view of the varied impacts of minimum wage on different demographics.

A constraint I encountered was the balance between comprehensive data presentation and maintaining a succinct, engaging narrative. There's always more data that could be included, but the art lies in selecting the data that best tells the story without overwhelming the reader.

The most exciting part of this project was seeing the narrative come to life through the integration of personal stories. These narratives transformed the cold hard facts into something palpable, evoking empathy and understanding in a way that numbers alone never could.

In hindsight, I would revisit the user research phase to include a wider audience range, ensuring even broader perspectives are considered. This might have added additional layers to the story and possibly uncovered other angles or calls to action that weren't initially apparent.

Overall, "Earning a Living" stands as a testament to the power of storytelling with data. It was a project that not only demanded technical skill and creative thinking but also an acute awareness of the audience's perceptions and needs. The experience has reinforced my belief in the transformative potential of data when it's woven into a narrative that speaks to the heart of human experience.
