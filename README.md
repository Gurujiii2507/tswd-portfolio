This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU!  Here's where all my cool work will go.  You should probably hire me. 

# About me 
“Do what you love and you'll never have problem with Mondays.”

Ever since I was a kid, I have been fascinated about computers and technology. I still remember the day when I got to use computer for the first in my school and the enthusiastic engineer inside me was born. Throughout these years, my interests have been swinging around technology which encouraged me to pursue Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering.

Technology was not the only thing that intrigued me, my father’s business venture also played a major role in my interests in business and management. I used to spend my summers with my father at our company which had helped me learn the fundamentals of business i.e., trust. Trust is the backbone of each business and the whole world relies on it. It is very important for the person before you to have trust and faith in you which would help them mutually. Spending my time with people from various domains and businesses helped me learn a lot of life skills and management skills that are key to any successful running business.

With management skills and a business-oriented mindset, I was now more inclined towards roles that would help me solve the critical business problems with the help of technology. This is when I started learning about Cloud Computing and how the scaling business can leverage the benefits of using cloud in their infrastructure. During my internship at Celebal Technologies, I worked with multiple clients for their existing workloads and delivered fault tolerant and highly availability solutions for their business helping them scale efficiently and migrate to more efficient cloud premise. Since then, I have worked on multiple projects and also contributed towards the AWS Community. As AWS Cloud ambassador, I have helped many students to start their career in cloud by conducting various events and helping the peers learn about the opportunities in cloud. 

But as we say, learning never ends, which led me to Carnegie Mellon University, where I am an Information System Management. My interests lies in Product Management and Business Analysis. I am Passionate about solving problems and eager to work on technology that challenges my skills.
